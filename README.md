This is an individual homework assignment from COSC 2436.
Using linked lists, we can perform add, remove, and sort operations.
In the input file, we receive a list of names, ages, deposit, and number of drinks. These will be the values in the nodes.
In the command file, there can be three operations: add, remove, and sort.
After the commands, we print the final list in the output file.
